<p align="center">A neumorphic styled minesweeper game with its core written by ChatGPT</p>

## The Problem

AI chatbot, notably ChatGPT, has been a huge fad recently. Lots of YouTubers have made videos trying to ask ChatGPT to code them something. That really piqued my interest, and I wonder if I could do something similar. Coincidentally, I've got a plan to make a minesweeper game using javascript for quite a while, so I might as well take it as the subject of the experiment.

## The Solution

So yeah I asked ChatGPT politely to give me a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to create a minesweeper game using ChatGPT, and it turns out pretty well. For more information, there's a button with OpenAI's icon at the top right corner of the website, I've put the whole conversation of me and ChatGPT there.
